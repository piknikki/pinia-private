# From Vuex to Pinia
Vite scaffolding with Vue 3 and Pinia for state management

# Local Setup Instructions
```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run local server with database
yarn run dev
```

If you're having issues with running the json-server for the database, you will also want to run the following command to run the database server separately.

```sh
# Run database
yarn run db
```
